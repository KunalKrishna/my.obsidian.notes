| I         | a class should not be forced to depend on methods it does not need         |
| D         | high-level components of the code should not rely on low-level components. |

| I         | break large all encompassing interface down into smaller, focused interfaces. |
| D         | Both high & low-level components should rely on abstractions.                 |
